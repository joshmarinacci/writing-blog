    <h3>Day One</h3>
    <h4>2019-08-16</h4>

<p>Every story has a beginning and here is mine.  I've been writing non-fiction pretty much
since my career in software began, but I've never written much fiction until recently. I'm not quite
sure <b>why</b> I decided to start now, but I know it has something to do with my desire to stop the
bad things in the world from happening.</p>

<p>You see, in my day job I work on bringing VR and AR technology to the world. I'm really excited
about the potential of these technologies, but I also have to be honest, there may be some terrifying
side effects. I've realized (or at least 'come to believe') that one good way to spread ideas is through
stories. </p>

<p>Humans are social status seeking monkeys. Part of that means we think in terms of stories. The stock market
may rise and fall due to random factors beyond our control, but we will construct a narrative around it anyway
    about bull and bear markets.  We humans <b>really</b> like stories.</p>
