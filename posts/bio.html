<p>I'm a new author writing mostly hard-scifi in the near future, with the occasional side quest into
    far distant realms. Most of all I try to make my writing fun and funny.
</p>

<p>During the day I work at Mozilla (the makers of Firefox) on Virtual and Augmented Reality standards and tools, and trying
    to ensure this new technology is used well and thoughtfully. Basically
    my job is to make sure <i>Black Mirror</i> doesn't become real.
</p>

<p>I live in sunny Eugene Oregon with my wife, 8 year old son, and two cats.  Being the father of a current child
gives me unusual insight into the future. For example, in the future we will all have our own Youtube channel
    and live sporting events will be replaced by unboxing videos. Terrifying!
